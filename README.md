# Whack-A-Mole
Whack-A-Mole Android App Game

Simple Whack-A-Mole game created in Android Studio. Two different pages - the Main Activity and the Endgame. The Main will be where the player will play the game.
The game is set up with 12 holes where the moles can ramdomly appear at. Once the game starts the player is must tap on the moles that appear on the screen. The
player has to tap on the moles that appear on the screen. The difficulty of the game will increase as the player continues through the game; the amount of time given
to hit the moles will get faster. If the mole is not tapped in the amount of time given, the mole will disappear and the number of misses is increased. There are
two ways to end the game; either pressing the 'End Game' button on the Main screen or if the player hits the maximum number of misses(5).
The maximum score for the player is saved using Shared Preferences in the Android App.
